	<p class="intro">I'm a full stack engineer (and manager) living and working in San Francisco, CA.</p>

	<p>
    Born and raised in Canada, I made the move to the Bay Area in 2013 to join <a href="http://weebly.com">Weebly.com</a> as an Engineer, which has since changed to Director of Engineering. Previously, I was working at <a href="https://tophat.com/">Top Hat</a> to make coursework better for students and teachers alike. I've also worked at <a href="http://fluidmedia.ca/">Fluid Media</a> doing consultancy and client work, as well as brief stints at <a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/ideaworks">Mohawk IdeaWorks</a> (focusing on Electronic Health Record visualization and analysis) and <a href="http://storeimage.com">Storeimage</a> (focusing on SCM and logistics).

    I'm interested in almsot anything programming related, with a particular interest in bringing the versatility of web technologies to the desktop. I currently work with PHP and Javascript, and spend my spare time working with Python, Ruby, Rails, with a sprinkling of everything in between on top.
