  <h1 class="postTitle">Deep Diving into ORMs</h1>
  <p class="meta">January 14, 2016 | <span class="time">6</span> Minute Read</p>
  
  <p>It&#39;s rare that I advocate writing something from scratch when an off-the-shelf solution will fit your needs perfectly, as is almost always the case with an ORM.  This time, I got a little too curious, and I <em>wanted</em> to know how the sausage was made.</p>

<p>It all began with a discussion at work about which ORM solution we should poke with a few sticks. Our schema can be a little <em>wonky</em>, and we&#39;re doing a few <em>strange</em> things, and a good chunk of the off-the-shelf offerings work great when everything is done <em>perfectly</em>.  We weren&#39;t perfect. It was time to figure out how these things <em>really</em> worked. It took less than 30 minutes for my insanity-riddled brain to decide, &quot;Hey yeah, you could probably just write one from scratch really quick.&quot;.  Oh boy.</p>

<h3 id="what-39-s-it-gotta-do">What&#39;s it gotta do?</h3>

<p>Like almost any library or project I work on, I try to tease out the public API first.  It&#39;s a lot easier to architect something if you know what you want the finished product to look like. An architect always draws the building before putting down a foundation.</p>

<h4 id="models">Models</h4>

<p>At the most basic level, the ORM has to handle mapping objects to data from your database. I&#39;m a big fan of the patterns that <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">ActiveRecord</a> and <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent">Eloquent</a> have taken, and used them for inspiration.  Users should be able to define a model by defining a simple class.  A few pieces of configuration should also be provided in the form of static variables:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static $table = null;</span>
<span class="x">    public static $primary_key = null;</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Models should provide a few simple methods that can access, modify, and delete data.  Instances of models should also have methods to persist changes to the database, and to delete the local instance:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static find($primary_key){...}</span>
<span class="x">    public static destroy($primary_key){...}</span>
<span class="x">    public save(){...}</span>
<span class="x">    public delete(){...}</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="query-interface">Query Interface</h4>

<p>The methods above are pretty <em>ok</em>, but they&#39;re nowhere near advanced enough to handle the types of data and relationships that we&#39;ll be dealing with in the real world.  The Query Interface is the combination of more advanced methods that allow users to build more complex queries. These methods allow users to add limits, ordering information, and custom query parameters:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">Model::where(&quot;column &gt; ?&quot;, 10).limit(50).order(&quot;created_at&quot;);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Users should be able to chain as many of these methods as they want, eventually calling &quot;execute&quot; to get the data.  Some other methods also &quot;end&quot; the chain and return explicit values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">Model::where(&quot;a &gt; ?&quot;, 10)-&gt;execute(); // Get the data</span>
<span class="x">Model::where(&quot;a &gt; ?&quot;, 10)-&gt;count(); // Count the records</span>
<span class="x">Model::where(&quot;a &gt; ?&quot;, 10)-&gt;sample(5); // Randomly sample n records</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="associations">Associations</h4>

<p>Now that I knew how the API would work (from an absurdly high level), it&#39;s time to figure out how associations should be defined.  Most of your models are going to have related data in another table, and it should be easy to get to it.  I opted for having a single static array to define each of my association types.  It forces a logical grouping for your associations in code, and the Associative Array syntax makes the task easy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class User extends Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static $has_many = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;tasks&quot; =&gt; [&quot;class&quot; =&gt; &quot;Task&quot;, &quot;foreign_key&quot; =&gt; &quot;owner_id&quot;],</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>

<span class="x">    public static $belongs_to = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;team&quot; =&gt; [&quot;class&quot; =&gt; &quot;Team&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>

<span class="x">    public static $has_one = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;profile&quot; =&gt; [&quot;class&quot; =&gt; &quot;Profile&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="validations">Validations</h4>

<p>Models should provide a simple way to ensure that data is properly formatted before it gets stored in the database; we need to <em>validate</em> it. Much like my approach to Associations, all validations will be defined in one big bucket:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class User extends Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static $validations = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;name&quot; =&gt; [&quot;present&quot;],</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;email&quot; =&gt; [&quot;present&quot;, &quot;unique&quot;, &quot;email&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ]</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For the time being, I&#39;m not going to concern myself with exactly how a string like &quot;present&quot; will convert into a validation.  Remember, at this point, we&#39;re just painting with broad strokes.  We can worry about the details later.</p>

<h4 id="scopes">Scopes</h4>

<p>A lot of times, you&#39;ll be accessing data in a similar pattern.  Blogs almost always order posts with the most-recent submissions being first. Perhaps your blog posts will have a &quot;Published&quot; flag, to determine if they&#39;re visible or not.  These things should be easy to define on the model, so users don&#39;t need to rewrite the same query over-and-over.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class Post extends Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static $scopes = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;published&quot; =&gt; [],</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;recent&quot; =&gt; []</span>
<span class="x">    ]</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I toyed with the idea of using another class-level object to group these together, but scopes are so highly configurable that that solution felt limiting.  Scopes should be able to define filter criteria, order clauses, limits, and more.  I opted for using a method name convention on the class level instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class Post extends Model {</span>
<span class="x">    function scopePublished(){</span>
<span class="x">        return self::where(&quot;published = true&quot;);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>

<span class="x">    function scopeRecent(){</span>
<span class="x">        return self::order(&quot;created_at&quot;);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="and-more">And More!</h4>

<p>After we have all the big picture items sorted out, it&#39;s time to take a look at some of the &quot;nice to haves&quot;.  I poked around a few existing ORMs and found a few neat features that can add a lot of power to our shiny new toy:</p>

<h5 id="custom-attributes">Custom Attributes</h5>

<p>Sometimes you&#39;ll want your model to be able to handle data that isn&#39;t going to persist in the database.  The obvious example is creating a new <code>User</code> record.  You&#39;ll want to set <code>password</code> and <code>password_confirmation</code> on the model, and have them validate accordingly, but they won&#39;t be saved to the database (at least, not in their current form).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class User extends Model{</span>
<span class="x">    public static $custom_attrs = [&quot;password&quot;, &quot;password_confirmation&quot;];</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h5 id="advanced-chaining">Advanced Chaining</h5>

<p>We have a lot of really cool ideas defined above, including scopes, advanced query building, and associations.  These should all play nicely together, and a user should be able to use them in conjunction with one another to get to the data the need in record time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">User::find(1)-&gt;posts()-&gt;published()-&gt;where(&quot;active = ?&quot;, true)-&gt;order(&quot;created_date&quot;)-&gt;limit(5);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above would find all published sites belonging to the given User, where the site is marked as <code>active</code>, ordered by the <code>created_date</code>, and returning a maximum of 5 records.  That&#39;s a really easy to read and concise way to get to the data, and I think meets our needs perfectly.</p>

<h3 id="the-end-result">The End Result</h3>

<p>Alright, we&#39;ve just painted a pretty descriptive blueprint of where we want this ORM to end up.  Based on the above, I could define a pretty thorough class to describe a table and all of it&#39;s associated data and requirements.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">class User extends Model {</span>
<span class="x">    public static $custom_attrs = [&quot;password&quot;, &quot;password_confirmation&quot;];</span>

<span class="x">    public static $has_many = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;posts&quot; =&gt; [&quot;class&quot; =&gt; &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;foreign_key&quot; =&gt; &quot;author_id&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>

<span class="x">    public static $belongs_to = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;organization&quot; =&gt; [&quot;class&quot; =&gt; &quot;Organization&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>

<span class="x">    public static $validations = [</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;email&quot;    =&gt; [&quot;present&quot;, &quot;unique&quot;],</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;name&quot;     =&gt; [&quot;present&quot;],</span>
<span class="x">        &quot;password&quot; =&gt; [&quot;present&quot;, &quot;matches&quot; =&gt; &quot;password_confirmation&quot;]</span>
<span class="x">    ];</span>

<span class="x">    function scopeActive(){</span>
<span class="x">        return self::where(&quot;active = ?&quot;, true);</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I think that&#39;s a pretty good starting point.  We&#39;ve got a target we can aim for, and a set of features that every <em>real</em> ORM has.  In the next post, we&#39;ll start getting into the finer details of how our code will work, what the internal structure will look like, and how it all gets glued together.</p>
