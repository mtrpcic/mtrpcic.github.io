We've all been there. You're working on a project, and you're not sure which path to take.  Should that button be red, or blue? Should those corners be rounded, or square?  Should we make that list vertical, or horizontal?  From something as innocuous as your color scheme to something as important as a core feature, it's always valuable to ensure that the changes you're making are pushing the proverbial needle in the right direction.

One of the best ways to tackle this problem is with A/B Testing, a simple premise with a lot of nooks and crannies to fall into. Let's dig in and see how we can make use of A/B Tests to get the most bang for our buck.

### How It Works
A/B Testing is a very simple concept. When you want to make a change to your product, it's best to test the change and ensure your users are receptive, and the change doesn't cause any drastic issues for your customers. To accomplish this, you'll have two different versions of the feature, "Version A" and "Version B".  Half of your users will get the former, and the other half the latter. After enough data has been collected, you'll be able to see which version performed better. It's that easy!
