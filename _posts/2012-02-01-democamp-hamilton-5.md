I've been invited to speak at DemoCamp Hamilton 5 on February 9th of this year. I'll be giving a brief demo of PathJS, a client side routing library that leverages the power of "Hashbang" URLs in an intuitive wrapper. This will be the first time at a DemoCamp Hamilton that a code library is demo'd (as opposed to product demos), and I'm incredibly excited to have the opportunity to break that particular ice.  Nearly every demo thus far as either been web-based, or had some web-based component.  PathJS allows all of these products to leverage the latest web technologies to improve performance and make the leap from _web page_ to _web application_.  See you there!
