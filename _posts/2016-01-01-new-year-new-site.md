For a long time, my site has sat stangnant, a desolate and dusty Wordpress blog that contained a few thoughts and musings from years past.  I've tried, over and over, to get back into content creation for my personal site, but I always fall short. Whether I get too busy with work, find a more involving hobby, or straight up forget, things end up the same way; no blog updates.

Well, this year I'm starting from the ground up.  I'm moving off of Wordpress (a move I've wanted to make for a long time), and have opted to let most of my previous posts evaporate into the ether in the process. I've grown and changed a lot since they were written, and would rather revisit those topics as they come up, with fresh eyes and fresh insight.

So, here's to 2016 and (hopefully) a plethora of fresh thoughts, ideas, and content!
